Overview
========
The SDCARD FatFs FreeRTOS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It reads/writes
/erases the SD card continuously. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver
with FatFs and freeRTOS in SDK software to access SD card.
Note: The output log of the case is not constant, since difference of card access speed and platform will affect the behavior of card access task.
