Overview
========
The SDCARD FATFS project is a demonstration program that uses the SDK software. It mounts a file 
system based on a SD card then does "creat directory/read directory/create file/write file/read file"
operation. The file sdhc_config.h has default SDHC configuration which can be adjusted to let card
driver has different performance. The purpose of this example is to show how to use SDCARD driver 
based FATFS disk in SDK software.
